                    "One of these is not like the others!" Can you spot the diffrence between
                    a grid of letters? I will show you a <strong>HUGE</strong> list of letters,
                    all of 'em are the same... except for one! Your goal is to scan through the
                    whole grid and find the "Odd One Out." Better be quick, cause in this game, 
                    nothing is too easy. I will be generious and give you 20 seconds to find him,
                    but <em>me being me,</em> will only give you one guess to do so. On a final
                    note, your answer should be in all <strong>CAPS</strong> for it to be accepted
                    Failure to do so, will lead to your elmination. But your sucess will reward you 
                    250pts!
